# Specification Quality Checklist: Agent Éditorial & Concurrentiel

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-01-25  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

-  No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
  - **Status**: ⚠️ PARTIAL - Spec contains some technical stack details (FastAPI, PostgreSQL, etc.) in Technical Constraints section, but this is acceptable as it's a project foundation spec with constitutional alignment requirements
-  Focused on user value and business needs
  - **Status**: ✅ PASS - Clear problem statement, benefits, and target users defined
-  Written for non-technical stakeholders
  - **Status**: ✅ PASS - User stories use plain language, business-focused scenarios
-  All mandatory sections completed
  - **Status**: ✅ PASS - Overview, User Stories, Requirements, Success Criteria all present

## Requirement Completeness

-  No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain (High/Medium priority resolved)
  - **Status**: ✅ PASS - All high and medium priority clarifications resolved (2025-01-25):
    1. ✅ Authentication Strategy - Resolved: No auth for MVP, rate limiting by IP
    2. ✅ Multi-Tenancy - Resolved: Single-tenant MVP only
    3. ⚠️ LLM Providers (Low priority) - Deferred to planning/post-MVP
    4. ✅ Data Retention - Resolved: 90 days retention with auto-purge
    5. ⚠️ Internationalization (Low priority) - Deferred, focus FR first
  - **Note**: 2 low-priority clarifications remain but don't block planning.
-  Requirements are testable and unambiguous
  - **Status**: ✅ PASS - All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria with Given/When/Then scenarios
-  Success criteria are measurable
  - **Status**: ✅ PASS - Success Metrics section includes quantitative targets (time, precision %, satisfaction scores)
-  Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
  - **Status**: ✅ PASS - Metrics focus on user/business outcomes (e.g., "< 3 heures", "> 85% précision")
-  All acceptance scenarios are defined
  - **Status**: ✅ PASS - Each user story has 2-3 detailed acceptance scenarios
-  Edge cases are identified
  - **Status**: ✅ PASS - Scenarios cover edge cases (site inaccessible, contenu limité, aucun concurrent trouvé)
-  Scope is clearly bounded
  - **Status**: ✅ PASS - Clear functional boundaries, max limits defined (200 pages, 100 articles, etc.)
-  Dependencies and assumptions identified
  - **Status**: ✅ PASS - Dependencies section lists external services, infrastructure, prerequisites

## Feature Readiness

-  All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
  - **Status**: ✅ PASS - Each FR linked to user stories with detailed scenarios
-  User scenarios cover primary flows
  - **Status**: ✅ PASS - 5 epics covering: analysis, competitor research, scraping, topic modeling, API orchestration
-  Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
  - **Status**: ✅ PASS - Success metrics align with functional requirements
-  No implementation details leak into specification
  - **Status**: ⚠️ PARTIAL - Technical Constraints section intentionally includes stack (constitutional compliance requirement). Acceptable for project foundation spec.

## Constitutional Compliance

-  Specification aligns with `.specify/memory/constitution.md`
  - **Status**: ✅ PASS - Spec includes "Constitutional Compliance Declaration" and explicitly references constitution
-  All technical choices match Article I (Architecture & Stack)
  - **Status**: ✅ PASS - Stack matches constitution (Python 3.10+, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Qdrant, Ollama, etc.)
-  Code standards align with Article II
  - **Status**: ✅ PASS - Requirements specify type hints, async, Pydantic validation
-  Testing strategy matches Article III
  - **Status**: ✅ PASS - Success Criteria includes test coverage targets, Definition of Done includes testing

### Critical Clarifications Status

**✅ All high-priority clarifications resolved (2025-01-25):**

1. **✅ Multi-Tenancy (High Priority) - RESOLVED**
   - **Decision**: Single-tenant MVP uniquement
   - **Impact**: Simplified DB schema (no tenant_id), single Qdrant collection

2. **✅ Data Retention / RGPD (High Priority) - RESOLVED**
   - **Decision**: 90 days retention with automatic purge
   - **Impact**: Auto-purge job required, GDPR compliance via clear retention policy

3. **✅ Authentication Strategy (Medium Priority) - RESOLVED**
   - **Decision**: No authentication for MVP, rate limiting by IP only
   - **Impact**: Simplified API architecture, public API with IP-based rate limiting

## Validation Results Summary

### Metrics

- **Total Requirements**: 14 Functional Requirements (FR-001 to FR-014)
- **Total User Stories**: 10 (across 5 epics)
- **Coverage %**: 100% (all user stories have acceptance criteria)
- **Ambiguity Count**: 2 clarifications remaining (low-priority, non-blocking)
- **Duplication Count**: 0
- **Critical Issues Count**: 0 (all high-priority clarifications resolved)

### Overall Status

✅ **SPEC QUALITY: EXCELLENT** - Ready for planning (all critical clarifications resolved)

### Issues Status

1. **✅ High Priority**: Multi-Tenancy decision - RESOLVED
2. **✅ High Priority**: Data Retention / GDPR policies - RESOLVED
3. **✅ Medium Priority**: Authentication strategy - RESOLVED
4. **⚠️ Low Priority**: LLM provider abstraction (deferred to planning/post-MVP)
5. **⚠️ Low Priority**: Internationalization (deferred, focus FR first)

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.plan` (for high-priority clarifications only)
- Medium/low priority clarifications can be resolved during planning phase
- Spec is well-structured and comprehensive for a project foundation
- Constitutional compliance is explicitly verified
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic and measurable
- All user stories have detailed acceptance scenarios

**Recommendation**: ✅ **READY FOR PLANNING** - All critical decisions resolved. Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to generate technical architecture plan.
